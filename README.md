**Encapsulation**

In this principle a private object has private fields including method(s) and variables. 
Other objects can call on the private object using public methods.
However, these public methods can't directly modify the private fields of that object. 

**Abstraction**

This concept aims to handle complex internal implementation by hiding this information for users. 
Thus, only the most relevant information is revealed including high-level mechanisms for using the objects.  

**Inheritance**

In this principle a class is created that holds methods. This class is referred to as the parent class. 
A child class is created and it takes the methods and fields of the parents class. 
However, it can also create its own methods and variables which makes this class unique and different from the parent class.

**Polymorphism**

This principle describes the notion that objects can access other objects using the same interface. 
So, an object can have its methods and the child classes can calculate or implement its own verison of the parent method.
